Toggling this option on will make your survey private (evidently, this means only those you invite to participate in the survey may access it); for the sake of simplicity, we'll leave this option alone for this demonstration. To add a new question to the survey, click the 'Add Question' button in the upper-right corner of the page. There are currently 4 types of questions we can add to a survey (we'll cover each one in this section and introduce more details as we go).
